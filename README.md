# OpenCV-Learning
OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez. The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source.

## What is Computer Vision?
Computer vision is a field of computer science that focuses on enabling computers to identify and understand objects and people in images and videos. Like other types of AI, computer vision seeks to perform and automate tasks that replicate human capabilities. In this case, computer vision seeks to replicate both the way humans see, and the way humans make sense of what they see.

## What are the uses of Computer Vision?
### Content Organisation 
Computer vision systems already help us organize our content on the basis of similarity.  
Example: Apple Photos  

### Facial Recognition
Facial recognition technology is used to match photos of peopleâ€™s faces to their identities.  
Example: Facebook.    

### Augmented Reality
Computer Vision helps AR apps to detect physical objects in real-time and use this information to place virtual objects within the physical environment.  

### Self Driving Cars
Computer vision enables cars to make sense of their surroundings.  

### Healthcare
Image information is a key element for diagnosis in medicine because it accounts for 90 percent of all medical data. Many diagnoses in health are based on image processing and image segmentation proved its effectiveness during medical scans analysis.
